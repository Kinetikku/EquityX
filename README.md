# EquityX
Scenario: You have been hired to create a cross platform application EquityX, that allows users to simulate the trading of various equities such as stocks and crypto currencies.

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul><li>Add and withdraw funds to and from the application. â€“ Funds should be in USD and
are used to buy assets (stocks and cryptocurrencies). I can only withdraw <= the total
USD cash balance within the application. Assets are not automatically sold if I
attempt to withdraw >= my current USD cash balance.</li><li>
Simulate the purchase and sale of equity/assets (also known as stocks or
cryptocurrencies) from a variety of markets (FTSE, Dow, DASDAQ, et cetera).</li><li>
Display live market information on assets (stock or cryptocurrencies).</li><li>
Display the total value of all assets (including available funds) within my
portfolio(s).</li><li>
Display summary information on my investments. This may be individual assets
such as Microsoft stocks, all assets of a particular type (crypto currencies or all
equity). For example, I may have purchased 10 units of Microsoft stock each month
for three months. I should see the cost of each individual purchase, the difference
based on the current live value of Microsoft stock and my overall profit or loss for
each purchase and my entire holding of Microsoft stock.</li></ul>
